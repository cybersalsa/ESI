# ESI
ESI Project (Elaborazione di Segnali e Immagini) that identifies a song given a sample using MATLAB

This project was developed during the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Universit√† degli Studi di Verona with one of my colleagues, Filippo Lovato.

The comments are written in italian for readability since the project and the course were taught in that language.
